# Reference Cluster Evaluation

A series of scripts to evaluate the configuration and functionality  of a cluster. The configuration tests are designed for a cluster built with the cluster config instructions in this [documentation](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/cluster_build_methods/manual/centos8_slurm_multi_manual/introduction/).

See [here](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/cluster_build_methods/manual/centos8_slurm_multi_manual/configuration_testing/) for information about the configuration tests.

See [here](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/functionality_testing/automatic_tests/#automatic-tests) for information about the functionality tests.

See [here](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/functionality_testing/automatic_tests/#automatic-web-suite-testing) for information about functionality tests for web suite.
