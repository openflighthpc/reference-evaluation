# Reference Cluster Evaluation

A series of scripts to evaluate the configuration and functionality  of a cluster. The configuration tests are designed for a cluster built with the cluster config instructions in this [documentation](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/reference_clusters/ref_cluster_centos8/introduction/).

See [here](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/reference_clusters/ref_cluster_centos8/configuration_testing/) for information about the configuration tests.

See [here](https://docs.openflighthpc.org/functionality_testing/automatic_tests/) for information about the functionality tests.
